media-queries-svg-background-size
=================================

An example of using media queries in SVG with the CSS background size property.

Browser requirements
---------------------

Your browser must support:

* Scalable Vector Graphics
* SVG in background images
* Media queries in SVG documents
* CSS `background-size` property

Your browser must also support all of the above features working together. It also helps if your browser has solid UI support for `<input type="range">`. 

As of publication (7 April 2013 if you're wondering) [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) is the only browser in which this demo works as intended. Other browsers _DO_, however, [support media queries in SVG](http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2009/10/12/how-media-queries-allow-you-to-optimize-svg-icons-for-several-sizes) (except for Internet Explorer 10), and the `background-size` property.
